      <p>This is not new for us, the earth is in danger.  Every day we consume our planet a little bit more. We always want to produce more and more. When we invented plastic, no one knew we would get here, and it was worse than any forecast possible. Mostly because plastic isn't biodegradable. If you need some numbers to understand, around 8 million tons of plastic end up in our ocean every year. Of course, you can think that's not too much. But next time you imagine yourself swimming in the Caribbean, add 8 million tons of plastic around you...</p>

      <p>After years of saying that we have to act, we finally started to move. But then, covid-19 arrived, and the environment passed in a second plan.  Cause, of course, the planet where we live can pass in a second plan. So we started producing and producing face masks and plastic gloves. And guess what, a large part is not reusable... So we needed a place to store our dear waste. And what better place than our friend the sea! </p>

      <h2 class="smallTitle" id="title3">How can we act?</h2>
      <p id="p">The first thing that men can do to save an already wounded planet, is limit plastic use. Yes, it's also due to covid, but the problem already existed before.  So we have to attack the basics of our system. Changing the way we think and more important the way we act. We can't think that things will work out themselves. In general, we have to try reducing our amount of plastic we daily produce. For example, using reusable plastic bottles or bags. It's important that plastic is recyclable. So to help us solve the mask pollution we must start using reusable masks that we can wash and continue using. It's important that they work well against coronavirus while not killing the planet. Also, try thinking about being a volunteer on a polluted beach, for example during the summer. You can have fun while saving our earth!</p>   </section>
